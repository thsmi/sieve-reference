    <h1>Convert</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      convert
      <em>&lt;quoted-from-media-type : <a href="./../../atoms/core/string.html">string</a>&gt;</em>
      <em>&lt;quoted-to-media-type : <a href="./../../atoms/core/string.html">string</a>&gt;</em>
      <em>&lt;transcoding-params : <a href="./../../atoms/core/stringlist.html">string-list</a>&gt;</em>
      ;
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      To simplify testing for supported and successful conversions, the
      "<a href="./../../action/ext/convert.html">convert</a>" action can also be used as a test.  As such, it will
      attempt to perform the requested conversion(s) and will evaluate to
      "false" if and only if at least one conversion failed.  The failure
      can be because a conversion was unsupported or because the data could
      not be converted (perhaps it had been corrupted in transit or
      mislabeled at its origin).
    </p>
    <p>
      This creates a new type of Sieve action, a "testable action".  The
      usage as a test is exactly the same as for an action, and it doubles
      as an action and a test of the action's result at the same time.  See
      below for an example of how this test can be used.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
      are converted to "image/jpeg".  If the conversions
      were successful, those messages are then filed into a mailbox called
      "INBOX.pics".
    </p>
    <div>
      <code>
        require ["fileinto", "convert"];
        if (convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg" ["pix-x=320","pix-y=240"])
        {
        &nbsp;&nbsp;fileinto "INBOX.pics";
        }
      </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Module</h2>
    <p>
      Convert : Requires import of the <code>"convert"</code> capability
    </p>
