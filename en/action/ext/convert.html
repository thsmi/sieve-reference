    <h1>Convert</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      convert
      <em>&lt;quoted-from-media-type : <a href="./../../atoms/core/string.html">string</a>&gt;</em>
      <em>&lt;quoted-to-media-type : <a href="./../../atoms/core/string.html">string</a>&gt;</em>
      <em>&lt;transcoding-params : <a href="./../../atoms/core/stringlist.html">string-list</a>&gt;</em>
      ;
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The "convert" action specifies that all body parts with a media type
      [RFC2046] (sometimes called "MIME type") equal to
      <em>&lt;quoted-from-media-type></em> be converted to the media type in
      <em>&lt;quoted-to-media-type></em> using conversion parameters specified in
      <em>&lt;transcoding-params></em>.  Each conversion parameter value has the
      following syntax: "<em>&lt;transcoding-param-name></em>=<em>&lt;transcoding-param-value></em>",
      where <em>&lt;transcoding-param-name></em> and <em>&lt;transcoding-param-value></em>
      are defined in CONVERT [RFC5259]. Messages that don't have any body
      parts with the <em>&lt;quoted-from-media-type></em> media type are not affected
      by the conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "convert" action can be used with Sieve MIME Part Tests
      [RFC5703], in the case that some, but not all of the body parts need
      to be converted, or where different body parts might require
      different conversions.  When the "convert" action appears in a
      "foreverypart" loop, it applies only to the body part being
      processed, and not to any other body parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the "convert" action appears outside a "foreverypart" loop, the
      conversion applies equally to all body parts -- that is, all body
      parts that have the "quoted-from-media-type" are converted, using the
      same transcoding parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single "convert" action will only apply once to any body part.  If,
      for example,
      <code>convert "image/jpeg" "image/jpeg" ["pix-x=100","pix-y=120"]</code>
      converts a larger JPEG image to the smaller 100 x 120
      size, that will be the end of that "convert" action on that body
      part.  The action will not see a "new" JPEG body part to process,
      resulting from the conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a "convert" action cannot be completed -- perhaps because the
      conversion failed, or because the requested conversion is not
      available -- that "convert" action MUST terminate and leave the
      message unchanged, rolling back any other conversions done by that
      action.  The script processing continues, and prior or subsequent
      "convert" actions are not affected.  No error condition is raised,
      and no partial conversions from a single "convert" action are
      allowed.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      In the following example, all "image/tiff" body parts of the message
      are converted to "image/jpeg" with image resolution of 320x240
      pixels.  The converted message is then subject to the implicit keep.
    </p>
    <div>
      <code>
         require ["convert"];
         convert "image/tiff" "image/jpeg" ["pix-x=320","pix-y=240"];
      </code>
    </div>

    <h2>Module</h2>
